/*
Storing values in cents
  - It's usually good practice to store monetary values in cents in your database to eliminate JavaScript floating-point errors and ensure greater accuracy.

Creating new dates
  - Finally, let's create a new date with the format "YYYY-MM-DD" for the invoice's creation date:

Revalidate and redirect
  - Since you're updating the data displayed in the invoices route, you want to clear this cache and trigger a new request to the server. 
  - Once the database has been updated, the /dashboard/invoices path will be revalidated, and fresh data will be fetched from the server.
